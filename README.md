# Group2Project (TripBuddy)

TripBuddy is an application designed to present people with options for activities to do in various cities to help better organize what to do on a vacation.

Users enter 3 cities to create a trip. Each trip destination will appear on a map and 10 tourism activities will appear for each of the destination stops. Users are able to save their trips to a database as well as create a unique user profile.
